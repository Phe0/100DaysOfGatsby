## Create a Gatsby Blog from Scratch

So, today I decided to start #100DaysOfGatsby since I've been wanting to learn how to use Gatsby and GraphQL for some time.
As the [blog post](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/100days/start-blog/) suggested, I decided to start by the [begginer Gatsby tutorials](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

### Set Up Your Development Environment

This section shows a little about the basics of the command line, how to create a Gatsby project and talks about the tools we will be using through the challenge;

### Get to Know Gatsby Building Blocks

This section starts showing a bit of how React works, how to create components, what they are, how to style them, what are props and how to use Links.

Aside from that, this section shows a really nice and simple tool called [Surge](https://surge.sh/), used for easily publishing static websites.

### Introduction to Styling in Gatsby

This section of the tutorial shows a little bit about how to style your website, starting by showing global styles and how to configure them.
After it talks about CSS Modules, which I didn't know about, it basically is a file that scopes your CSS.

### Creating Nested Layout Components

This part starts showing how to use a typography plugin to configure how your fonts will work in the project. It uses a specil file called gatsby-config.js, which I have to search more about later.

The main purpose of this section is to show how to use components to set a Layout that can be used in every page.

### Data in Gatsby

This is where the tutorial begin to show stuff I haven't seen before, it gives an overview of how to use GraphQL to query data to be used in components. For now, it only shows you how to get data you set in the gatsby-config.js file.

### Source Plugins and Rendering Queried Data

This section introduces you to GraphiQL, which is an IDE for graphQL.
Aside from that it shows you how actually use queried data in your components, getting file informations of the project.

### Transformer plugins

Here we use a plugin to transform markdown files into HTML, in a super easy way.

### Programmatically create pages from data

Until now we have been able to create and style components to show information, how to use graphQL to query data from files in the project and how to use plugins to transform the content of files.

Putting it all together, this section shows how to detect and transform markdown files into pages, making it super easy to add content to the website, from now on all we have to do to create a blog post and add it to the main page is to create a markdown file with the content you want to show.

### Overview

The first day of the challenge was already awesome and showed me how usefull Gatsby can be. I can wait to continue it and learn more about it.
