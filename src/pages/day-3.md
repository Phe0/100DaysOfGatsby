## Auto-Optimize Images on Your Gatsby Site

Today I've learned about how to use images in gatsby, it uses a built-in component to optimize images. To make the file calls easier, I've searched more about how to query files using graphQL and how to use the gatsby-remark-images plugin to manipulate the image in the graphQL query. As the challenge suggested I ended up adding an image in the Day 1 post, to learn how to add images inside de markdown file and added an about page to learn more about how to use the gatsby image API.
